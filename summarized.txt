As the cells break down the ATP, they release heat.

The heat stimulates temperature sensors throughout your body.

Those receptors detect the excess heat being produced by your muscle cells and communicate that information to the hypothalamus, which regulates body temperature.

The cells pump these ions into a hollow tube that runs through the sweat gland.

The water in sweat absorbs your body's heat energy and then evaporates off of you when it reaches the surface, which in turn lowers your temperature.

That happens because spices trigger the same neural response in the brain that activates temperature receptors, which usually respond to increased heat.

This happens because adrenaline stimulates muscle activity and causes blood vessels to widen, two responses that increase heat and trigger the sweating response.

When we're feverish, we sweat because infections stimulate the hypothalamus to increase muscle activity, which in turn releases more energy as heat.

Like with running, sweating helps your body vent that heat.

When the fever's over or you've won your race, your temperature receptors sense the decrease in heat and the hypothalamus brings your sweating response to an end.
